# DevFlow Project README

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app), designed to enhance developer workflow by integrating a comprehensive Q&A platform. Our stack includes Next.js 14 for the frontend and MongoDB for the backend, ensuring a seamless, scalable, and efficient application.

This project also serves as a showcase of my learning journey with Next.js. Please explore the various branches to see the most current version and track the progression of my skills and the application's development.

## Project Progress

As of now, I've successfully implemented several key features:

- **Home Page:** A welcoming interface with easy navigation to the main features of our application.
- **Authentication:** Secure authentication handled by Clerk, providing a safe and reliable user experience.
- **Ask a Question Page:** Allows users to submit questions, fostering community engagement and support.

### Upcoming Features

my roadmap includes several exciting features that are currently under development:

- **Community Page:** A dedicated space for users to interact, share knowledge, and connect with others.
- **Tags Page:** Enables easy categorization and filtering of questions based on specific topics or technologies.
- **Question Details:** Detailed view for each question, including responses, comments, and additional information.
- **Voting System:** Allows users to vote on questions and answers, highlighting the most valuable contributions.
- **Profile Page:** User profiles to manage personal information, track contributions, and customize the experience.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps:

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result. You can start editing the page by modifying app/page.tsx. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project utilizes next/font for automatic font optimization, loading Inter, a custom Google Font, for a polished UI.
